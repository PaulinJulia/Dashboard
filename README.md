## Description

This project is a personal Dashboard. The dashboard will have parts that you can customize by yourself as well as information that is retrieved from APIs.

This task tests the knowledge and ability to develop functionality on websites through Javascript as well as developing web interfaces in HTML and CSS based on a design sketch. All fields that you can customize by yourself will be saved in localStorage and all information that is retrieved from APIs is fetched with Axios.

On top of your dashboard, you can see today's time and date. Afterward, you have a title there you can revise to your own text.  
On your first card, you can add, save, and cancel web links you like and often use. By clicking add a link a form will display and ask for a name and the link to your web page.  
Your second card contains your local weather and the two following days weather. By using the Geolocation API the user allows to provide their location.  
On the third card, you have the top three latest headlines in Sweden there you can click on the headline and read the published article by the author.  
The last card has a text field where you can write some own notes.  
And on the bottom of your dashboard you can by a click on the button change the background image to un random photo from Unsplash.

## Strengths and weaknesses

This project's strengths are my personality to be organized and structured. Hopefully, the structure of the code is simple and easy to understand, and my willingness to learn how to code reflects this project.

In this project, I see improvement opportunities in making modules for each feature for easier management of test and control.
The features could have been written more as the expression async and await for a cleaner code.

The API that is used for the weather does not contain any icons which could have simplified the length of the code and reduced the workload. The function display weather could have been simplified by a higher-order function.

Regarding the card with the top three headlines, the code snippet that contains the picked values could have been simplified with a higher-order function.

In general, the code could have been better on error handling. It could have been better on catching errors meanwhile developing and for publishing this project displaying errors feel like a given user-friendly function.

During this project I have struggled against the time and lacking knowledge. It have been a big challange and therefore I think the perform of methods and errors have been sett aside to achive this project. But I am happy with the result so far and I have learned a lot.
